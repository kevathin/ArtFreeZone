So this project was ment to be an example 
for a workshop I was attending the next day.
I spent right about 7-8 hours total making 
this game with the time allocation going 
along like this: 1 hour drawing, 3 hours
researching, and give or take 3 and a half
hours coding. 

This game is not ment for memory allocation. 
It is not ment for the code to look nice. It 
is not ment for optimization.

This was just used as an example to a group
of interested people that it does not take
days to make something that resembles a game.
